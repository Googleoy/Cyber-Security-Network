## What is IPv4?

- **IPv4** stands for **Internet Protocol version 4**. Itâ€™s a system used to identify and locate devices on the internet by assigning them unique IP addresses.

## How Does It Work?

1. **IP Address**: Each device (e.g., computer, smartphone) on the internet has a unique identifier called an IP address, written as four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

2. **Numbers and Format**: Each number ranges from 0 to 255, so an address like 192.168.1.1 includes four such numbers.

3. **Purpose**:
   - **Identification**: An IP address helps devices find and communicate with each other.
   - **Location**: It ensures data is sent to the correct destination (e.g., emails or website requests).

## Why IPv4 is Important

- **Standard System**: IPv4 is the primary method for managing device addresses on the internet.
- **Limited Addresses**: IPv4 supports about 4.3 billion unique addresses, which is insufficient due to the growing number of internet-connected devices.

## Address Classes

1. **Class A**:
   - **Range**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
   - **Use**: Large networks (e.g., multinational corporations)
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.0.0.0

2. **Class B**:
   - **Range**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
   - **Use**: Medium-sized networks (e.g., universities)
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.0.0

3. **Class C**:
   - **Range**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
   - **Use**: Small networks (e.g., local businesses)
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0

4. **Class D**:
   - **Range**: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
   - **Use**: Multicast groups (e.g., streaming media)
   
5. **Class E**:
   - **Range**: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
   - **Use**: Reserved for experimental use and future applications

## Moving Forward

- **IPv6**: With IPv4 addresses running out, **IPv6** is introduced, providing a vastly larger address space to accommodate the growing number of internet-connected devices.

In summary, IPv4 is the key system that ensures devices can uniquely identify and communicate with each other over the internet.
