# what is the Network topology ?
A network topology is like the layout or map of how different devices (like computers and printers) are connected to each other in a network. 

## common types of network topologies : 

### 1. Bus Topology
##### What it is :
Imagine a single road with houses lined up on both sides.
##### How it works :
All devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus). Data travels along this cable, and each device checks if the data is meant for it.
##### Pros :
Simple and cheap to set up.
##### Cons :
If the central cable fails, the entire network goes down.

### 2. Star Topology
##### What it is : 
Think of a hub-and-spoke system, like a bicycle wheel.
##### How it works : 
All devices are connected to a central device (like a switch or hub). Data travels from one device to the hub, and the hub sends it to the intended device.
##### Pros : 
If one cable fails, only the connected device is affected, not the whole network.
##### Cons : 
If the central hub fails, the entire network is affected.

### 3. Ring Topology
##### What it is : Picture a circular track with devices placed around it.
##### How it works : Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring. Data travels in one direction around the ring until it reaches its destination.
##### Pros : Data packets travel at high speed and there is a predictable path.
##### Cons : If one connection breaks, it can disrupt the entire network, though some ring topologies have redundancy.

### 4. Mesh Topology
##### What it is :
Imagine a network of interconnected roads where every house is connected to every other house.
##### How it works :
Each device is connected to several other devices. This creates multiple paths for data to travel.
##### Pros : 
Highly reliable because there are multiple paths for data. If one path fails, data can take another route.
##### Cons :
Expensive and complex to set up due to the large number of connections.

### 5. Tree Topology
##### What it is :
Think of a tree with branches.
##### How it works : 
Devices are organized in a hierarchy, with multiple star topologies connected to a central backbone (like branches connected to a tree trunk).
##### Pros :
Scalable and easy to manage. Failure in one branch doesnâ€™t affect the whole network.
##### Cons :
If the backbone fails, the entire network can be affected.

### 6. Hybrid Topology

##### What it is : 
A mix of different topologies, like combining star and mesh.

##### How it works :
Uses a combination of two or more topologies to fit specific needs.

##### Pros :
Flexible and can be tailored to various needs and scales.

##### Cons :
Can be complex and expensive to design and maintain.

# Summary

- ### Bus : 
Single cable with all devices connected.
- ### Star :
Devices connected to a central hub.
- ### Ring :
Devices connected in a circular fashion.
- ### Mesh :
Every device connected to several others.
- ### Tree :
Hierarchical, like a tree with branches.
- ### Hybrid :
A mix of different topologies.

Each topology has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors like the size of the network, budget, and reliability requirements.
